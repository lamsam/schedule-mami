ABOUT

Schedule HTTP daemon is part of a project aimed to deliver teacher's schedule
to his/her mobile phone running Android, allowing for automatic updates.
It also demonstrates some of YB.ORM use cases.
The daemon was developed at Moscow State Open University (MSOU) by:
  Viacheslav Fedorov -- funny-story at yandex dot ru
  Andrey Skobenkov -- andrey dot skobenkov at gmail dot com
You need YB.ORM installed in order to build Schedule HTTP daemon.

The project consists of a single executable, which runs a minimal
HTTP server at port 19090.  The server processes XML-over-HTTP POST queries
of several types.  See the XML protocol description for details.


BUILD

On Windows you should use CMake build system. It is assumed
that YB.ORM resides in c:\yborm folder, then unpack this project here:
c:\yborm\src\examples\schedule
Then mkdir c:\yborm\build-schedule, copy proper build-*.bat and chdir there.
Use build script c:\yborm\build-schedule\build-*.bat.

To build Schedule under Unix, please use autogen.sh/configure scripts.
For instance, you can build and install YB.ORM locally as follows:
sh autogen.sh
./configure --with-test-dbtype=MYSQL --with-test-db=test1_db \
  --with-test-user=test1 --with-test-passwd=test1_pwd --disable-static \
  --prefix=/home/vaclav/inst1
make check && make install
zdes` vil vasya
Then you can build Schedule itself, like this:
sh autogen.sh
./configure --with-test-dbtype=MYSQL --with-test-db=schedule_db \
  --with-test-user=schedule --with-test-passwd=schedule_pwd --disable-static \
  --prefix=/home/vaclav/inst1 \
  --with-yborm-includes=/home/vaclav/inst1/include/yb \
  --with-yborm-libs=/home/vaclav/inst1/lib \
  --with-yborm-bin=/home/vaclav/inst1/bin
make
